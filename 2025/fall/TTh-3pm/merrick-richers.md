My favourite plant species is *Holodiscus discolor*, which also has the common names **Oceanspray** or **Ironwood**, it grows abundantly near my house and looks like seafoam when it first blooms. The only botanical illustration of this species that I can find in full color is in a century-old British journal, where it is called *Spiraea ariifolia*. You can find this illustration [here](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/c/c4/Edwards%27_botanical_register%2C_or%2C_Ornamental_flower-garden_and_shrubbery_.._%281829-1847%29_%2821171945425%29.jpg). I find this funny since *Spiraea douglasii* would be in the same genus as *discolor*, even though it looks nothing like Oceanspray.
