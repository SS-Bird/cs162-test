# About Me

Hi there! I'm Fortune, a junior at Minerva University on the Computational science and Artificial Intelligence track. I'm Nigerian; I tend not to speak a lot but do listen a lot. I have a lot of love to give out to the world.

### Things That Interest Me

In recent times, these are some of the things which have caught my interest. I'm currently on the pathway to develop a skill in these areas:

- Developing a stronger relationship with God
- Backend development with a focus on distributed systems
- Algorithms (especially graph theorems and graph algorithms)

### My adapted Mantra

`I don't worry about the things which I can't control, but instead focus on the things which I can control.`

### Some of the Movies I Started Seeing But Never Completed

1. The Resident (since 2021)
2. You (saw one episode, wouldn't be moving forward with it.)
